Layout

Need the location of the nodeframe in the canvas. need the width of the nodeframe.

Let oldX = Right edge of parent node
Let oldY = Top edge of parent node

Let newX = oldX + H_PAD

the first child will be (newX, oldY)

when a second child is added,
  first = (newX, oldY)
  second = (newX, oldY + V_PAD)

when a third child is added,
  first = (newX, oldY - V_PAD)
  second = (newX, oldY)
  third = (newX, oldY + V_PAD)

When a fourth child is added,
  first = (newX, oldY - V_PAD)
  second = (newX, oldY)
  third = (newX, oldY + V_PAD)
  fourth = (newX, oldY + V_PAD*2)
  
When a fifth child is added,
  first = (newX, oldY - V_PAD*2)
  second = (newX, oldY - V_PAD)
  third = (newX, oldY)
  fourth = (newX, oldY + V_PAD)
  fifth = (newX, oldY + V_PAD*2)

Therefore....

  first = (newX, oldY - (V_PAD * (numchildren //  2)))
  successive = (newX, priorY + V_PAD)

MOD FOR SUBCHILDREN

Let V_PAD, for a particular node, be the height required for all
children of that node to render without collisions.

Can we just recurse to a function in replace of V_PAD?

Maybe.. That would be handy.. I would indeed leave redisplay on
NodeBox, and then if any of the coords fall into the negatives,
continue, but at the end of all recursion, reposition.

WRONG. Can't always redisplay only a chunk at a time. It could affect
how other things need to be positioned.

-a-:-b-:-c-:-d-
  \:-e-:-f-:

-f- has three children. Need to reposition up the tree so -e- is
farther away from -b-.


Brute force...

I need to get the positions of all children, then map them to positive
x/y, then move them, then show them.


If I have node.getHeightOfChildren
