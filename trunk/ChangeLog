	* UI: Newly created nodes (with Return or Insert) are now
	automatically put into edit mode.
	* UI: Nodes now have a minimum width, so empty nodes aren't so
	weird looking any more.

	* UI: Nasty bugs fixed: pasting was broken in the 0.0.3 release
	:-( Now fixed. Also when inserting a child, expand the parent.

	* FreeMind: Updated infogreater/freemind.py to write the new
	format.

	* Installation: Add distutils support thanks to Sourav K. Mandal.
	* UI: When creating a new map, put some useful information for
	newbies in the root node.

	* UI: Use nicer names in the insert special node window.
	* UI: shift-up and shift-down work again.

	* FileSystem: Wow, the filesystem browser actually kind of
	works. shift-I, select makeFileSystem.

	* Persistence: A big rewrite, originally spurred by the need for a
	better file saving/loading solution. Switched from Pickle to an
	XML file format. To convert your old pickles to the new XML
	format, run 'python infogreater/upgradepickle.py YOUR_PICKLE >
	YOUR_XML'.

	* Node: TextFileNode, a new node that saves itself and its
	children as a simple bulleted text file.
	* UI: Finally implement a usable (i.e., you don't need to use the
	debugger any more) interface to TextFileNode. Use shift-I to
	create a new TextFileNode.
	* File I/O: Errors at save-time will be caught and shown to the
	user. This way we avoid saving truncated pickles that won't be
	loadable later. However, this still isn't fool-proof; we can still
	save buggy data without an exception occuring. Will work more on
	this.

	* UI: Display a GtkTree of your nodes on open; it doesn't yet
	follow changes you make.

2004-06-07  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* UI: Allow node shifting up and down with Shift-up/down.
	* UI: C-n/p/f/b are aliased to down/up/right/left.
	* UI: Ctrl-i also inserts nodes.
	* UI: Much better automatic scrolling to follow the selection.
	* UI: Fix the bug that made the auto-scrolling code not work when
	creating a new node.
	* UI: When typing off the edge of the screen, it will scroll to
	contain your text.

	* Infogreater 0.0.1 released.
