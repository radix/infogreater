About Infogreater
=================

See http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/infogreater/.

See LICENSE for licensing info. It's LGPL.

Infogreater is still alpha-quality software, so make sure to create
backups of your files; It's possible that IG might save a buggy file
that is unloadable. Eventually there will be automatic snapshots with
an auto-save feature that will make this less painful.


Keyboard controls
=================

    Ctrl-e: edit current node
    (Edit mode:
      Escape: Cancel editing
      Shift-Enter: Insert a newline
      Enter: Commit editing
    )

    Ctrl-x: cut current node
    Ctrl-v: paste under current node

    Right-arrow, Ctrl-f: Expand if unexpanded, move focus to child
    Left-arrow, Ctrl-b: Move focus to parent
    Up-arrow, Ctrl-p: Move focus to previous sibling
    Down-arrow, Ctrl-n: Move focus to next sibling

    Shift-up: Move the selected node up (before its previous sibling)
    Shift-down: Move the selected node down (after its next sibling)

    Insert, Ctrl-i: Create a new child
    Shift-i: Create a new special child
    Enter: Create a new sibling after the current one


Special Nodes
=============

TextFileNode
------------

This saves itself and its children in a simple text file with a nested
bulleted list, like the following:

-- snip --
TODO
====
 * Add more node types
   * RSS feed
   * Timeline
 * Fix layout bugs
   * black band showing up
     * over-scrolling causes this, I think
-- snip --

When you first create one (with shift-I), you will be asked for a file
name. You can either give it the name of a non-existent file or a file
that already exists and has this format; if so, it will be loaded (be
careful, the parser is very strict and doesn't automatically correct
errors, or even handle them gracefully).

Later, after you edit the node and its children, be sure to save it by
right-clicking on it and clicking "Save to ....".
