2004-07-14: Infogreater 0.0.3 released.

This release involved a huge refactor. The biggest user-visible change
is that it uses an XML file format instead of pickle files now. In the
off chance that you have an old pickle-format file, run 'python
infogreater/upgradepickle.py myold.pickle > mynew.xml'

  * Node: TextFileNode, a new node that saves itself and its
    children as a simple bulleted text file.
  * UI: Finally implement a usable (i.e., you don't need to use the
    debugger any more) interface to TextFileNode. Use shift-I to
    create a new TextFileNode.
  * File I/O: Errors at save-time will be caught and shown to the
    user. This way we avoid saving truncated files that won't be
    loadable later.
  * FileSystem: Wow, the filesystem browser actually kind of
    works. Use shift-I to insert one in your map.


2004-06-08: Infogreater 0.0.2 released. 

This release gets rid of many annoyances for simple mindmapping use,
but doesn't offer any fancy new features. Changes are as follows:

  * UI: Allow node shifting up and down with Shift-up/down.
  * UI: C-n/p/f/b are aliased to down/up/right/left.
  * UI: Ctrl-i also inserts nodes.
  * UI: Much better automatic scrolling to follow the selection.
  * UI: Fix the bug that made the auto-scrolling code not work when
        creating a new node.
  * UI: When typing off the edge of the screen, it will scroll to
        contain your text.

2004-05-13: Infogreater 0.1 released.
